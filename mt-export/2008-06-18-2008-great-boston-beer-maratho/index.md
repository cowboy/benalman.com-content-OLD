So, Jeremy picked up this cool gig for us, taking photos for the <a href="http://www.beermarathon.net/">Great Boston Beer Marathon</a>. What's that, you say? Boston, beer AND marathon? Hell yes. We're talking about an all-day, 26-bar Boston pub crawl starting near Fenway and ending in Allston.

So, were you there? Did you see thousands of people wearing red shirts and viking helmets? If so, you know exactly what i'm talking about. If not, you missed a great time, and had better go next year. Seriously, promise me you'll go next year. But wait--don't do it for me, do it for the beer.

Either way, before you do anything else, check out <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157605675712765/">some of my photos</a> from the event.
