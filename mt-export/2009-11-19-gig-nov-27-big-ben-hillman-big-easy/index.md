I've got a cool gig next week that you should definitely check out.. I'll be playing some funk with my good friend and long-time collaborator [Big Ben Hillman](http://bigbenhillman.com/) at the [Big Easy](http://www.bigeasyportland.com/) in Portland, Maine next Friday, November 27.

It's been a while since I've been able to jam with Ben, but he's put together a great band, so I'm really psyched. And it looks like we're opening for a band called "The Returnables" so be sure to get there early.. I think the doors open at 9pm.

Put this date in your calendar, and come out to the Big Easy next Friday! Don't miss it!
