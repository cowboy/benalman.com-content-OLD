I'm speaking at this year's [jQuery Summit][summit], a two-day online conference taking place on November 16th and 17th. In addition to my two talks, "Idiomatic jQuery" and "jQuery Pluginization," there will also be talks by a number of other well-known jQuery community members as well as [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/), creator of jQuery.

The first day, November 16th, consists of a more designer-oriented track, while the second day, November 17th, consists of a more developer-oriented track. While you'll learn lots by attending both days, if you can only attend one of the two days, fear not: I'm presenting in both tracks!

And here's an added bonus: I have a few tickets to give away for each day! First, follow me, [@cowboy](http://twitter.com/cowboy/), on Twitter if you aren't already following me. Then, send me a tweet telling me which track you'd prefer (Designer on 11/16 or Developer on 11/17), and finally, tell me why I should give you one of these tickets! I'll notify the lucky winners on Wednesday.

If you haven't already, [sign up now][summit], and I'll see you online!
