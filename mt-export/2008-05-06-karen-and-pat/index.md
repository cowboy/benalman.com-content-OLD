So, <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/tags/broadstreet,skellig/">everyone gathered at Skellig the other night</a> to wish a fond farewell to Karen and Pat, the two most recent casualties in the Cosmic Blender - Broad Street - Evoke Interaction roller coaster ride from hell. It seems like just the other day that we were saying <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/tags/broadstreet,stellinas/">goodbye to Michael</a> and <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/tags/broadstreet,asianafusion/">goodbye to Samantha</a> and goodbye to JB and Erwin.. and <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/2268316607/in/taken-on-2007-12-28/">me</a>.. of course.
