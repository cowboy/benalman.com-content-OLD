What is [Modernizr][mod]? Modernizr is a small JavaScript library that performs browser feature detection, allowing developers to easily enable or disable both JavaScript and CSS functionality based on what features are actually available in the browser. Modernizr isn't my project, but recently, [Paul Irish][paul] and I decided to attack the then-current 0.9 code base with gusto and rewrote it, optimizing a lot of the code and reducing the minified size by nearly 40%.

Our code, along with other improvements, has been incorporated into the now-final 1.0 release, so check [Modernizr][mod] out now!
