After using [Simple PHP Proxy][proxy] in countless projects, I've finally decided to clean up my code, document everything, and share!

With Simple PHP Proxy, your JavaScript can access content in remote webpages, without cross-domain security limitations, even if it's not available in JSONP format. Of course, you'll need to install this PHP script on your server.. but that's a small price to have to pay for this much awesomeness.

So, check out the [script, example, documentation and, yes, feline endorsement][proxy] to see how everything works, download it onto your server, and have fun!
