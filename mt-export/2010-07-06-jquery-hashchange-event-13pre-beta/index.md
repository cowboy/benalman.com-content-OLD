If anyone is interested in trying out the [latest version][latest] of the jQuery hashchange event plugin, I'd love to hear any [feedback or bug reports](http://github.com/cowboy/jquery-hashchange/issues).

New in this version are document.domain and document.title support for IE6/7, some Blackberry fixes, and an IE6/7-specific code reorganization which makes it easier for mobile-only developers to strip out that stuff (since they don't need it).

Either way, jQuery hashchange event 1.3pre is available at the [GitHub project page][latest] right now, and the only thing I'm waiting on before releasing it at this point is a bit more testing. Once it's done, I'll release it as 1.3 and integrate it into a new version of [jQuery BBQ](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/).
