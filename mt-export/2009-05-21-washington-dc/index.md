While visiting friends and family in and around Washington DC, Robyn and I visited the Air & Space Museum, the Natural History Museum, the Botanic Gardens, a whole bunch of memorials, and just enjoyed the beautiful weather. Check out <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157618440581390/">my photos</a> as well as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/robynalman/sets/72157617537682672/">Robyn's photos</a>, if you haven't seen them already!
