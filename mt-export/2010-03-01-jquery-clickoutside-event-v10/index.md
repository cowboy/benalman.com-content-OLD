With [jQuery clickoutside event][plugin] you can bind an event that will be triggered only when the user clicks outside the element in question. And because a reference to the clicked element is available as event.target you can change behavior based on what element is clicked.

This a fairly simple example of a jQuery "special event" plugin, so if you want to write one of your own, feel free to take a look at the [fully commented source code](http://github.com/cowboy/jquery-clickoutside/raw/v1.0/jquery.ba-clickoutside.js). If you just want to, like, actually use the plugin, [check out the project page][plugin]!
