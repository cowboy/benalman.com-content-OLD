I've just updated my [URL Utils plugin][urlutils] to v1.11, fixing a few minor bugs and adding onhashchange event support for browsers that support it. In case you're not familiar with URL Utils, it provides some very useful methods around Query String / Fragment handling, as well as urlInternal and urlExternal testing and filtering. Also included is a cross-browser fragmentChange event that allows for very easy-to-implement fragment history, even on IE6/7. Check it out now!
