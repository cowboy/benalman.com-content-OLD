<div class="photo"><a href="http://benalman.com/photo/taken-on/2008/07/26/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3239/2783207480_6fb1ac5717_t.jpg" /></a></div>

I just posted a few photos from our recent <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/taken-on/2008/07/26/">trip to Rockport, MA</a>. Also, check out <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/robynalman/sets/72157606546642056/detail/">Robyn's photos</a> if you have the time.

We went to the Newport Jazz Festival again this year, for both Saturday and Sunday. It was excellent, we had a great time, heard some amazing music, and took a ton of photos (I'm still sorting through mine). I should have those up sometime next week.

I'm also trying to get back into recording some of <a href="http://benalman.com/portfolio/website-personal-cowboy-v4/">my music</a> as well. I've been sitting on four or five completed songs plus a ton of ideas, and just need to spend some time working out the details. Hopefully I'll be able to spend some more time collaborating with <a href="http://bigbenhillman.com/">Ben Hillman</a>, since we've been exchanging song ideas here and there for a while now.

And finally, I'm looking forward to beta testing and then playing the upcoming MMORPG <a href="http://www.warhammeronline.com/">Warhammer Online</a> with Robyn and some of <a href="http://rj3.net/ckb/">my crazy "online" friends</a>. We all used to play <a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a> together, but got tired of the end-game loot/rep farming grind (that's MMO-speak for "repetitive, boring crap") so this might be the change of pace we're looking for. We'll see.
