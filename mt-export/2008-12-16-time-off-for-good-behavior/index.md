<div class="photo"><a href="http://benalman.com/photo/3098121882/in/set-72157610956941272/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/3098121882_e61f8e7dd9_t.jpg" /></a></div>

It's not that I didn't want to update my <a href="http://benalman.com/news/">News</a>, it's just that I wanted to wait until I had all my photos from our recent trips to <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157610956941272/">Cancun</a> and <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157611210313093/">Puerto Rico</a> sorted, tagged and uploaded. It just took a lot longer than I thought it would, because there were so many good photos (and because I took my damn time).

Robyn and I don't have any more vacations planned until next July, so I should have no excuse in the future to keep things updated. That being said, I've been busy lately..

Let's see.. I've been collaborating on some music with musician and friend <a href="http://danabreu.com/">Dan Abreu</a>, I created a small corporate website for <a href="http://viewpointlifestyle.com/">Viewpoint Lifestyle</a>, and I've even found some time to play Little Big Planet on PS3, which by the way, totally rocks. And of course, with the holidays coming up, there are lots of <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/2152270183/in/set-72157603596376215/">presents under the tree</a>, so Robyn and I are both pretty excited.

If I get any good loot from Santa, I'll write about it here. I promise!
