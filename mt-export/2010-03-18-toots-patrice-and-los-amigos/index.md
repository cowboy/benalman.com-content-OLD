Recently, Robyn and I have had the good fortune to see some truly awesome music performances.

Most recently, we saw [Toots Thielemans with Kenny Werner and Oscar Castro-Neves](http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157623644217550/) at Scullers. This show was amazing, the trio played flawlessly.. and it was just fantastic to see not only eighty-seven year old Toots (who actually called himself a "black motherf\*\*\*er from Belgium" on stage), but also Kenny and Oscar, who maintained an amazing rhythmic and harmonic counterpoint throughout the show (punctuated by amazing solos).

Before that, we got to see [Buster Williams with Patrice Rushen, E.J. Strickland and Mark Gross](http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157623644227898/) at Scullers. Not only was it an awesome show, but I actually got to [meet Patrice Rushen](http://benalman.com/photo/4403229012/in/set-72157623644227898/) (!!!) which was a total thrill, since I've been a huge fan of hers for quite some time. Ever since I heard <s>Men in Black</s> her first two albums, _Prelusion_ and _Before the Dawn_ (and of course, the amazing _Straight from the Heart_), I've been totally hooked.

And last month, we had a damn good time seeing [Los Amigos Invisibles](http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157623519726811/) again, back at the Paradise. We never miss them when they come around, and it was yet another great show, lots of groovy, sexy Venezuelan dance-funk, which is awesome if you like music that kicks serious ass.

I know we have tickets to see Bobby McFerrin and Roy Haynes within the next month, so hopefully I'll be able to take (and then actually _post_) photos to at least one of those shows!
