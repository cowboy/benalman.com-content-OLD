This Friday, September 24 (tomorrow!!), I'm playing with [Trick Bag](http://trickbagmusic.com/) at [The Tap](http://www.tapbrewpub.com/) in Haverhill, MA. We're going to be playing both instrumental and vocal funk, NOLA-style, so if you like to get your groove on, this is definitely the place to be on Friday night.

We'll be going on at 9pm, and the place has plenty of beer (how could it not, with a name like "The Tap"), so come on down and shake your moneymaker!

Find out more details and let us know that you're coming by RSVPing at the [Facebook event page](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=161658717177570).

_Note: I initially posted this gig as October 24, but it's actually September 24. Sorry for the confusion!_
