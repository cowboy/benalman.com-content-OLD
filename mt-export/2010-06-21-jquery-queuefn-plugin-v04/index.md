[jQuery queueFn][plugin] is a very small plugin that allows you to queue any jQuery method or arbitrary function to execute, in order, in the animation queue.

This is especially useful for when you want to add a class to an element while animating or remove an element after fading out. Of course, this plugin can be used to queue pretty much anything along with animations, so have fun!

Check [jQuery queueFn][plugin] out now, and if you have any comments or suggestions, let me know, thanks!
