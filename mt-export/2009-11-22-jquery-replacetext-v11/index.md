Recently, [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/) asked me how I would go about "wrappifying" text on a page with span tags, presumably for some CSS styling.. and he knows that if he mentions something enough, there's a pretty good chance I'll make a jQuery plugin for it!

That being said, [jQuery replaceText][plugin] will replace text in specified elements. Note that only text content will be modified, leaving all tags and attributes untouched.

As always, check out [the plugin page][plugin] to find out *why* you'd want to use this plugin (along with examples and documentation), and let me know what you think!
