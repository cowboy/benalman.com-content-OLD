For the second year in a row, Jeremy and I took photos for the [Great Boston Beer Marathon](http://www.beermarathon.net/), an all-day, 26-bar Boston pub crawl starting near Fenway and ending in Allston.

It was pretty much the same as last year: beautiful weather, more beer than you could possibly drink, thousands of people wearing viking helmets.. except this year, the shirts were green. Don't believe me? Take a look at [some of my photos](http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157621155457105/)!
