Now that the site redesign is done, I figured I'd lead off with a web development-related post. From the [jQuery iff plugin][iff] project page:

This relatively simple and very small jQuery plugin gives you the functionality and power of a standard JavaScript "if" statement, without breaking the chain. In one way, iff operates like .filter(), in that it allows you to conditionally process a subset of selected elements, but instead of allowing you to preserve or remove individual elements, it operates on the entire set of elements.

Feel free to check out the [jQuery iff plugin][iff] now, and let me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions!
