After I had gone to sleep last night, [Jonathan Neal](http://thewikies.com/), author of the [jQuery SWFObject plugin](http://jquery.thewikies.com/swfobject/), [jQuery sIFR plugin](http://jquery.thewikies.com/sifr/), [CMS.txt](http://cms.thewikies.com/) and the creator of the [yayQuery podcast](http://yayquery.com/) theme song posted a new track into IRC...

Here's the chat excerpt:

 &lt;jaubourg&gt; what better than a benalman.com ad video answer?
 &lt;headcold&gt; ben is going to wee himself

I'm a little sad that I missed all the fun in IRC last night, but I was busy trying to keep two rambunctious kittens off my pillow. And just for the record, I didn't wee myself. But it was pretty damn close.
