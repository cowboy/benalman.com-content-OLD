With [jQuery resize event][plugin], you can now bind resize event handlers to elements other than window, for super-awesome-resizing-greatness!

Long ago, the powers-that-be decided that the resize event would only fire on the browser's window object. Unfortunately, that means that if you want to know when another element has resized, you need to manually test its width and height, periodically, for changes. While this plugin doesn't do anything fancy internally to obviate that approach, the interface it provides for binding the event is exactly the same as what's already there for window.

It's easy to use, fun for the whole family, and will get those tough grass stains out of your favorite pair of pants, so [check it out][plugin] now!
