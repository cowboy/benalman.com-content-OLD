With [jQuery outside events][plugin] you can bind to an event that will be triggered only when a specific "originating" event occurs *outside* the element in question. For example, you can click outside, double-click outside, mouse-over outside, focus outside (and over ten more default "outside" events). Also, if an outside event hasn't been provided by default, you can easily define your own.

Note that this was previously known as the "jQuery clickoutside" plugin.. but, hey--it's pretty amazing what a an [awesome idea](http://blog.petersendidit.com/post/jquery-focusoutside-event/) and few more lines of code can do!

Visit the [project page][plugin] now for the complete list of "outside" events, documentation and working examples!
