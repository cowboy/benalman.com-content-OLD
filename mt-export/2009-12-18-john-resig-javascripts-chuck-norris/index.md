Some of the regular irc.freenode.net #jquery guys have come to the conclusion that [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/), creator of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), is the JavaScript world's equivalent of Chuck Norris, so we came up with some ideas and decided to pay homage to him in a blog post.

Note: he might actually _be_ Chuck Norris, we're not entirely sure.
