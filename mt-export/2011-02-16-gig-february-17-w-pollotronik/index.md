Tomorrow night, February 17, the Pollotronik All*Stars are playing some killer funk at [Toad](http://toadcambridge.com/) in Porter Square, Cambridge.

And since [Steve Giannaros](http://stevegiannaros.com/) just sent an email out to his mailing list promoting the gig, I figured I'd just quote him here, verbatim, and save myself the effort of saying the exact same thing:

_As some of you may know, the Pollotronik All-Stars have taken a bit of a hiatus, as the band's founder and fearless leader, Yahuba Garcia, has been extensively touring with the Ryan Montbleau Band, Martin Sexton, among others... On Thursday, 2/17, the Pollotronik All-Stars will be back in full force at Toad in Cambridge! No cover, usually things get started sometime after 10, and we will play late into the evening - <http://toadcambridge.com>. You will witness an obscene amount of jamming and hear improvisation at its finest, as well as songs by artists such as Herbie Hancock, John Coltrane, Mongo Santamaria, and Robert Glasper, to name a few._

_The lineup:  
[Yahuba Garcia](http://www.pollotronik.com/) - congas and Percussion  
[Peter MacLean](http://benalman.com/grab/b75ba1.png) - drums  
[Jason Cohen](http://www.ryanmontbleauband.com/jason.php) - keys  
[Ben Alman](http://benalman.com/) - bass  
[Dan Abreu](http://danabreu.com/) and Myself - dueling tenor saxophones and EWIs._

_The secret ingredient, and the basis of this band, is that we have never once rehearsed and wouldn't have it any other way. So, if you didn't know, now you know._

So that's what Steve had to say. Killer funk, killer lineup.. and because it's Toad, killer beer. I'll see you there!
