I recently bought a Nikon D40 (and a D50 just before that, long story, forget I mentioned it) in preparation for the upcoming honeymoon. Seattle, Vancouver, a week-long cruise to Alaska.. you know, crazy photo opportunities.

So, I've wanted to get more into photography for a while, and finally bit the bullet and got myself a nice camera. And I've been taking a lot of photos lately, learning how not only aperture, shutter speed, and ISO affect things, but also that I need to take about a million shots to find one that looks just right. Still, in the midst of all this experimenting, I've managed to take a <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157600245058605/">few nice shots</a>.
