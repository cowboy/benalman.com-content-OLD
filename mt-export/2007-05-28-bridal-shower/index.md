This weekend has been quite "productive" so far.

Robyn had her <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157600274194997/">bridal shower</a>, and some family and friends showed up to give her gifts. Crate &amp; Barrel was well-represented. We now have two place settings (note: if you're not yet married or getting married, this is a very exciting thing, trust me)

Seriously, we need to have bridal showers more often. Ren√©e gave Robyn some sexy lingerie! Seriously!
