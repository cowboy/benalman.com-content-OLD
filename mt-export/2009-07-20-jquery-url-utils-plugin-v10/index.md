I've finally released version 1.0 of my [URL Utils plugin][urlutils], after working on it for quite some time. This plugin provides some very useful methods around Query String / Fragment handling, as well as urlInternal and urlExternal testing and filtering. Also included is a cross-browser fragmentChange event that allows for very easy-to-implement fragment history, even on IE6/7.

Please check out the [URL Utils plugin][urlutils] now, and let me know how it works for you in the comments, thanks!
