First of all, thanks to everyone who came out last friday for the crazy [Big Ben Hillman][bbh] / [Nephrok! Allstars][neph] double-header at Johnny D's, it was an awesome gig!

This Saturday, September 11, I'll be playing again with [The Nephrok! Allstars][neph] at [Atwood's Tavern](http://www.yelp.com/biz/atwoods-tavern-cambridge) in Inman Square, Cambridge. Doors open at 9:30, the cover is only $5, and this place has a killer beer selection, so be prepared to get your funk _and_ your drink on.

Either way, I hope to see you there!
