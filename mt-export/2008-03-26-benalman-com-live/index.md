After sitting on the <a href="http://benalman.com/">benalman.com</a> domain for what seemed like forever, I finally decided to do something with it. The old <a href="http://benalman.com/portfolio/website-personal-cowboy-v4/">RJ3 Cowboy 4.0 website</a> was great, but I just wanted a fresh start on a new server (that didn't have nearly ten years of accumulated files).

I took the <a href="http://benalman.com/portfolio/">portfolio</a> / <a href="http://benalman.com/resume/">resume</a> mini-website that I created last year, added in a Movable Type <a href="http://benalman.com/blog/">blog</a>, and then created a <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/">custom photos index page</a> using the Flickr API. After all that, I widened it by a few pixels and <a href="http://benalman.com/">this</a> is the result.

It's a work in progress, as I'd like to create some kind of homepage mashup of my latest news post, featured portfolio items, and some recently uploaded photos.. and I would also like to add a music section.. but at least I've laid the groundwork.
