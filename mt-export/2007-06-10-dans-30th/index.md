Our friend Dan turned 30 this weekend, so we all got together in Watertown for some excellent Persian food. The restaraunt was BYOB, so we certainly did!

Over the course of the evening, the requisite level of hijinks was met, of course. And Kym didn't hold back with the beatings. Dan got plenty of <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/tags/dans30th/">birthday beatings</a> at the dinner. Dan likes birthday beatings. Or so I'm told. Well, not told really. But I'm guessing that he's down with birthday beatings, all of us men are.
