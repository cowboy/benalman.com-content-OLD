Just over [a year ago](http://benalman.com/news/2009/12/jquery-bbq-in-drupal-7/), I blogged that [jQuery BBQ][bbq] was going into version 7 of the popular open source [Drupal CMS](http://drupal.org/), as a crucial part of the overlay module.

The [overlay module](http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/overlay) allows the Drupal admin interface to appear seamlessly, as a modal window, on top of the current page, while maintaining that page's context. This was, of course, a great idea, and one that [jQuery BBQ][bbq] made easy, with its built-in cross browser HTML5 `onhashchange` event and fragment management functions.

And now that Drupal 7 has finally launched, jQuery BBQ provides back button support in [over 20,340 sites](http://drupal.org/project/usage/drupal), not to mention the sites where it was already being used, of course.

Pretty sweet, huh?
