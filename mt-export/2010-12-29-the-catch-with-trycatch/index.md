In some of my recent work on a much-needed update to [JavaScript Debug][debug], I noticed a few "interesting quirks" with [try...catch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) in Internet Explorer 6-8, so I decided to write an article with my observations.

As a change of pace, I decided to post this article to the [Bocoup weblog][blog]. It's actually my first article over there, so you should give it a read, and let me know what you think!

In related news, progress on [JavaScript Debug][debug] has been moving steadily forward, and I hope to have a new version out within a few weeks (which probably means a few months, given my current workload). Either way, stay tuned, because good things are in the works!
