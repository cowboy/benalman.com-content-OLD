With [jQuery Message Queuing][jqmq], you can process and manage operations on large queues of items or elements. You can throttle, giving each operation a little breathing room (firing tracking pixels, performing DOM manipulations). You can force multiple asynchronous operations to execute serially (AJAX requests).

Either way, this is a useful plugin.. but, of course, only if you need this kind of thing. Check it out now on the [project page][jqmq] and let me know what you think!
