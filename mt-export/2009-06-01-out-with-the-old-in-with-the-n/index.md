<div class="photo"><a href="http://benalman.com/photo/3586989097/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3634/3586989097_20398ce6bf_t.jpg" alt=""/></a></div>

If you only take a quick glance at the newly renovated <a href="http://benalman.com/">benalman.com</a> and compare it with the <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/3586989097/">old version</a>, you might not notice much of a change, but a lot has happened in the last few months, since I started redesigning the site.

For starters, I rewrote all the Movable Type templates from scratch, giving me a much more generalized HTML structure to build on, and allowing cool new features like posting on-site comments using your Facebook or AIM accounts. After that, I updated the previous design with more vibrant colors, increased the font size and content width to make for easier reading, and added lots of little bits of polish here and there.

In addition to all those changes, I condensed the sidebar significantly, and added in a new <a href="http://benalman.com/projects/">Projects</a> section that will feature many new CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery plugins pages over the next few months, and beyond (Music pages coming soon!).
