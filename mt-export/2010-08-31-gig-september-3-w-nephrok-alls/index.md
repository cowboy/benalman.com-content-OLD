I'm playing a sick double bill this Friday night, laying down the bass with not one, but _two_ amazing funk bands. I'll be playing with both [Big Ben Hillman][bbh] and [The Nephrok! Allstars][neph], and we'll be hooking up an entire evening of the most killin', super funky grooves you've ever heard.

On top of that, both groups are going to do a set together at the end of the night, at which point a gigantic intergalactic supernova funk-splosion will be created, so be sure to rock the [protective eyewear](http://harryallen.info/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/bootsy-collins-bootsy-player-of-the-year-big.jpg). You _definitely_ won't want to miss this.

The gig is at [Johnny D's](http://www.johnnyds.com/) in Somerville, MA on Friday, September 3 at 9:30pm. The show is 21+, the cover is only $10, and it's going to be EXTREMELY FUNKY, so you'd better show up. This goes double if you haven't seen me play before, in that case you need to either show up twice (probably physically impossible), or bring someone else (definitely possible, recommended).

If you want more information, you can RSVP at the [Facebook event page][event], so check that out.. and I'll see you there!
