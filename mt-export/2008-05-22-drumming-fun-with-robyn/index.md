It was great to see Robyn play out with her drum ensemble at the Drum Connection's "Acacia in Kenya Scholarship Fundraiser" benefit performance last weekend. I've been playing music for a long time, and I've had countless gigs.. but it was a real treat for me to get to see Robyn having fun, playing djembe and dunun, on stage in front of people. I managed to get <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/2512954222/in/posted-on-2008-05-21/">some decent photos</a> of the group (ok, mostly of her) playing.. check them out!
