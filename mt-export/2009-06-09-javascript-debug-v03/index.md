From the [JavaScript debug: A simple wrapper for console.log][debug] project page:

This code provides a simple wrapper for the console's logging methods, and was created to allow a very easy-to-use, cross-browser logging solution, without requiring excessive or unwieldy object detection. No third-party JavaScript API or console required, tested in Internet Explorer 6-8, Firefox 3, Safari 3-4, Chrome, Opera 9.

Please check out [JavaScript debug][debug] now, and as always let me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions!
