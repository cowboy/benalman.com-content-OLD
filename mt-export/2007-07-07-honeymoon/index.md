Robyn and I are relaxing in Vancouver right now, we're leaving for our cruise tomorrow afternoon. Seattle was lots of fun, we met up with some friends and family, saw the Space Needle, and had a great time. There isn't too much to do in Vancouver, but we went to the aquarium and the science museum. It's nice to walk around here, and the weather has been perfect. The honeymoon is basically going as well as the wedding went, which is "fantastic-alicious" in case you were wondering.

I've taken some great <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157600692792477/">honeymoon photos</a>, just from Seattle so far. Vancouver and the cruise will probably have to wait until we return, unless I can get some Vancouver photos up tomorrow morning. Internet time is a bit expensive on the ships, so I doubt I'll be uploading photos then.
