This would probably actually be better called "Run some arbitrary code that requires jQuery, loading a minimum required version of jQuery first (but only if necessary), affecting the host page as little as possible Bookmarklet" but that wasn't nearly as catchy as "[Run jQuery Code Bookmarklet][plugin]" so I'm going to stick with that.

This boilerplate code is useful for bookmarklets that need jQuery to execute their payload, in situations where you don't know if jQuery or a specific minimum required version of jQuery will already exist in the page.

Also, an easy-to-use [bookmarklet generator](http://benalman.com/code/test/jquery-run-code-bookmarklet/) has been created to streamline the process!

As always, please check out the [Run jQuery Code Bookmarklet][plugin] now, and let me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions!
