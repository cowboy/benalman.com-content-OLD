So I'm currently sitting in a room at the [Microsoft NERD](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newengland/) center, in a room with a few hundred other [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) developers, listening to [Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/) give a talk on jQuery best practices. I've seen some great talks this weekend. [Steve Souders](http://stevesouders.com/) gave an excellent talk on maximizing front-end performance, [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/) gave a great talk on upcoming changes to jQuery 1.3.3, [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/) gave a few very successful talks on jQuery anti-patterns and custom web font usage, and [Rebecca Murphey](http://www.rebeccamurphey.com/) is coming up next with her talk on organizing your code using object literals.

I actually did a thirty minute breakout this afternoon, called "jQuery plugin creation: organization, generalization, minification, optimization, gratification," which seemed to be well-received, even though I felt a little rushed. Either way, very soon I'm going to put it all together here as a series of posts (and eventually screencasts) for everyone.

Today was my first time speaking like that in front of a group of people, so that's a great thing. And next year, I'll definitely put more material together and try to do a "real" session in one of the big rooms. I've already got some great ideas.

In case you missed it, my presentation is available, after the jump.
