I've had a lot of requests for music recently, and it's been a long time since I've posted any kind of music that even tangentially involves me.. but since I just had a really funky gig (that I recorded), I thought I'd post some tracks from the show.

So, without further ado, check out these tracks from my gig with [Big Ben Hillman @ The Big Easy](http://benalman.com/music/big-ben-hillman-the-big-easy/), and as always, let me know what you think in the comments!
