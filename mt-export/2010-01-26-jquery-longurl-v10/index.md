[jQuery Long Url][plugin], the "Uniform Resource Elongator," uses the [longurlplease.com](http://www.longurlplease.com/) short URL lengthening API to expand short URLs from at least 80 services, including bit.ly, is.gd, tinyurl.com and more!

And not only has jQuery Long Url been written to take advantage of the longurlplease.com API "batch" ability, where up to ten URLs can be lengthened per request, but it can optionally use any lengthening service, supporting any URL-per-request "batch" limitations, which minimizes the number of external requests made for faster performance.

[Simplified](http://benalman.com/projects/simplified-style/), my Linkinus Style, utilizes an earlier, unreleased version of this plugin.. but now that it's finally available for general consumption, [consume away][plugin]!
