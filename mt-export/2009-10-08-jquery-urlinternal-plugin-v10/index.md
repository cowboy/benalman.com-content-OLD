I've just posted v1.0 of my [jQuery urlInternal][plugin] plugin, which will allow you to easily test internal-, external-, or fragment-ness for any relative or absolute URL. The plugin includes element filtering methods and pseudo-selectors, as well as some helpful configuration methods, should you need them. Check out the [project page][plugin] as well as the source on [GitHub][github].

And now that both [jQuery urlInternal][plugin] and [jQuery BBQ][bbq] are completed, the URL Utils plugin is completely obsolete. It will still continue to work, of course, but will no longer be supported or updated, because the new plugins are better! Seriously!
