You may have noticed that I've been posting a lot of boring (if you're family) or exciting (if you're a web developer) [jQuery plugins](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery/) lately. If you're family, I apologize, I know it's boring. If you're a web developer, thanks for the suggestions and donations!

As you're no doubt aware, I have a lot of interests. I'm an artist, musician, photographer, web developer, husband, and all-around good guyâ„¢, among other things. But I'm not always able to focus on all of my interests at the same time. For example, I've been taking a break from music lately and focusing on the web stuff, with a little bit of photography thrown in for good measure. It goes in waves, just be patient with me!

And in case you haven't heard the good news, Robyn and I are buying a house, which has us both very excited. Once we've closed, I'll start posting photos of the place and our ongoing work there. We've already figured out pretty much all the furniture we need, so there's not too much left to be done, other than buying a grill and a few hundred pounds of red meat (yummy).

Either way, I just uploaded some photos from a recent [Alman family barbecue][bbq], and in case you missed them, check out my photos from the [2009 Boston Beer Marathon][beer]. More photos (and other stuff) coming soon!
