Recently, Robyn planned a little weekend trip for us to <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157607616081776/">New York City</a>. We walked around Times Square, Central Park, saw Young Frankenstein on Broadway, and Larry Carlton at the Blue Note. Robyn took <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/robynalman/sets/72157607220987770/detail/">some photos</a> too, so check them out (I especially love her <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/robynalman/2846723381/in/set-72157607220987770/">Trump Tower</a> shot).

Even more recently, we saw the Red Sox of Boston take on the Indians of Cleveland. And in the end, the Red Sox triumphed by hitting a spherical ball made of leather through a big field. It was a most ripping victory. Ok, it wasn't even close to a most ripping victory, but the first inning (and maybe <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/taken-on/2008/09/24/">a few other things</a>) were entertaining.

Last, but not least, I finally upgraded my <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/2879131134/in/tag-homestudio/">home music studio</a> to a brand new machine running SONAR 7. The photo I uploaded to Flickr was, ironically enough, featured in an article on <a href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2008/09/29/optimizing-for-vista-inside-the-mechanics-of-sonar-8-with-cakewalk-engineering/">optimizing SONAR 8 for Vista</a>. I don't even run Vista.. but shhâ€“don't tell anyone, okay? Either way, I'm working on writing and recording music again, so expect more tracks from me, soon!
