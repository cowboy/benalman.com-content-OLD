Newport was a lot of fun again this year. We saw Dave Brubeck, Marcus Miller, Branford Marsalis, Joshua Redman, Christian McBride, Chico Hamilton.. the list of amazing musicians goes on and on.

The weather was perfect, the music was fantastic, and we had a great time. And I got some <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157601393143107/detail/">good photos</a>.. and a sunburn!
