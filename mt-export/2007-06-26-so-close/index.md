So, my wedding is four days away. I'm not nervous, but I'm definitely glad we worked out all the details well ahead of time, because the last thing I can imagine doing right now is.. all that stuff. And I'm pretty excited now.. especially since I've finished making all eighty <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/624722696/">favors</a>.

I think I'll continue to bask in the moment just a little longer... ok, that's long enough. I still have two more days of work left, and lots (er.. all) of packing left to do.
