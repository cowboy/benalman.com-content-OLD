This weekend, Robyn and I went up to Portland, Maine with <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/2430448475/">Brian and Melissa Coakley</a> to check out the <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/tags/greyboyallstars,asylum/">Greyboy Allstars</a> at Asylum. First things first: the opening band sucked, hard. But we weren't there to see them, we came for the Greyboys.

Simply put, they were awesome, playing a good number of tracks of their latest album along with some of their classics (including Soul Dream, the first song of theirs I ever heard). The best part for me was that Robyn really dug the show, and said she'd gladly see them again. Awesome.

If you'd like to read more, check out <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/tags/greyboyallstars,asylum/">my photos</a> from the show.
