The <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157603596376215/">holidays</a> were great, I got (and gave) some fun presents! The new job is great, and I've been kept very busy with some exciting projects that I'll post about soon. The <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/2152270867/">new TV</a> is also great! Oh, I didn't mention that? Robyn won it at work in a raffle. 42" 1080p HDTV. Insanity. The <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157603847676894/">Superbowl</a> was pretty fun, even though the Pats lost.. but the game LOOKED awesome on the TV.

Other than that, there isn't much to report. A good start to the new year!
