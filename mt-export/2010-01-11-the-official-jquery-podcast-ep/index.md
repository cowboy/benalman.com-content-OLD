Recently, [Elijah Manor](http://elijahmanor.com/) and [Ralph Whitbeck](http://ralphwhitbeck.com/) asked me if I'd like to be a guest on the [Official jQuery Podcast](http://twitter.com/jquerypodcast). Of course, I agreed.. and last week, [Episode 6][podcast] was recorded.

First, let me just say that it was a lot of fun! We had a lot of laughs, and not all at Elijah's expense (but mostly), and actually talked about some useful, jQuery-related stuff.

We talked about plugin development, code organization and one of my contributions to jQuery 1.4 core. We also discussed some general suggestions for developers who want to contribute to the jQuery project, but aren't sure how to get involved, and I gave a rundown on a handful of my plugins, what they're called, what they do, etc.

In addition to the actual "useful" stuff, we heard a few of my tunes, I explained where the nickname ["Cowboy"](http://benalman.com/portfolio/website-personal-cowboy-v4/) came from, and oh yeah, we talked about the hottest new John Resig-related internet meme!
