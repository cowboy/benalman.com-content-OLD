The title of this post pretty much says it all, so you might as well not even bother reading the rest. But if you must..

First, I've updated [jQuery BBQ](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/) to 1.0.2, fixing a few minor IE bugs along the way. Things should now fully work in IE8's "Compatibility Mode" and "IE7" modes, as well as in IE6/7 when used on a page with an `https://` protocol. If you do notice any other bugs, please let me know.. and if you notice a bug you can fix (and test), fork BBQ on [GitHub](http://github.com/cowboy/jquery-bbq)!

Also, I've fully moved the source of [JavaScript Debug](http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/) over to [GitHub](http://github.com/cowboy/javascript-debug), so check that out.

And I've actually created a plugin "shell" that I will be using as the basis for all my jQuery and JavaScript projects on GitHub, which should facilitate my moving everything over there. I'll (obviously) post more on this as I move things, so stay tuned!

Oh, and if you missed it late last week, I created the "world's first" [jQuery Star Wipe](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-starwipe-plugin/) plugin, so be sure to check that out. It's mind-blowing. Or not.
