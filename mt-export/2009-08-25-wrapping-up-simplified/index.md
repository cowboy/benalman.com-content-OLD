Even though many more features are planned for Simplified, it's reached the point where it's stable, works reliably, and there's just no reason not to include it with [Linkinus](http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus). We're going through some final beta testing right now, and everything looks good for a 2.0.2 release.

Already done:

 * Text copy & paste still works just like you'd expect, no bizarre formatting issues!
 * Full support for nearly all Linkinus style options, including the new 2.0.2 variants feature.
 * Short-URL auto expansion (full URL visible on hover).
 * Smooth scrolling animations.
 * Adium emoticonSet support.
 * Exploding emoticons - just click them!
 * Clicking on a nickname will spotlight that user's text in that channel.
 * The style also functions as a framework for style authors.

Still left to-do:

  * Fix remaining linkification issues.
  * Add "embed media" support.

A Simplified page on benalman.com with screenshots, documentation, and an explanation of features is in the works, and should be completed soon. As always, feel free to come to [#Simplified on irc.conceited.net](irc://irc.conceited.net/Simplified) for the latest version!
