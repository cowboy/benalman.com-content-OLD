[JavaScript debug][debug] has been updated to v0.4, adding a few missing passthrough console methods: `exception`, `groupCollapsed` and `table`. Thanks to [Riccardo De Agostini](http://github.com/rdeago) for the patch!

If you've never used it before, this JavaScript plugin provides a simple wrapper for the console's logging methods, and was created to allow a very lightweight, easy-to-use, cross-browser logging solution that doesn't require excessive or unwieldy object detection. In addition, there's a convenient bookmarklet which adds Firebug lite compatibility.

Find out more information on the [project page][debug], and give it a try!
