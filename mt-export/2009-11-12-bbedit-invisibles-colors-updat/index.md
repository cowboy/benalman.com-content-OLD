Today, when I started [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/), it asked me if I wanted to update to the latest version (9.3), and after it installed, I was greeted with a lovely surprise: there is now an option to set "Invisible characters" colors in the preferences!

Apparently, Rob Griffiths posted about this on [Macworld](http://www.macworld.com/article/141416/2009/06/bbeditcolor.html) shortly after I posted it to [my blog](http://benalman.com/news/2009/06/change-bbedit-invisibles-color/) and to [Mac OS X Hints](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20090611071930139), which must have given it a bit of traction. Unfortunately, I didn't get a link back to my original post, but the end result is the same.. the feature is now officially in the app!

Thanks, Barebones, for a great product!
