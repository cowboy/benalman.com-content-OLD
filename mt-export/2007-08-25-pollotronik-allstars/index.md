The Pollotronik All*Stars got together for our "annual gig" at Lizard Lounge last night, opening up for Organism at their CD-release party. We were damn funky, the gig was a lot of fun, and hopefully Yahuba will get us some more in the future!

Head on over to my Flickr page and check out <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/tags/pollotronikallstars/">the photos</a> from last night!
