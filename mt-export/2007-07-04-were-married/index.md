The wedding couldn't have gone better. The weather was perfect, pretty much everyone we invited made it out there, and everyone I've spoken to said they had a great time. Deb did a fantastic job of officiating the marriage, Sweet Willie D and the band funked it up the whole time, and Ben, Jeremy, and Nick gave a fantastic "group toast." And after the whole wedding was over, a bunch of people headed just down the road to Mohegan Sun to continue the good times throughout the night.

Here are some of the <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157600485749638/">pre-wedding and wedding photos</a> I found on my camera. Some were taken by me, but I think most of them were taken by Nick. More will be added as I get them.
