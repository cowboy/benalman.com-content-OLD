The [doTimeout plugin][dotimeout] does everything that setTimeout does, but allows you to more easily cancel individual timeouts, override existing timeouts with new ones, and even force execution of a callback before its timeout is set to run. In addition to all those convenience features, doTimeout is fully [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) chainable.

Check out the documentation and examples over at the [doTimeout plugin][dotimeout] page now, and let me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions!
