I'd never been to Martha's Vineyard before, but Robyn, Jeremy, Kristin and I all took a trip down there together for the Memorial Day holiday long weekend. The weather was pretty much perfect, and we had an amazing time. I took <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157605275886991/">a ton of photos</a> from all over the island, so check them out.

And I actually ended up heading down there a day early with <a href="http://www.gregluttrell.com/">Greg Luttrell</a> to do a friday night gig with Blacksnake at the Ritz Cafe in Oak Bluffs. The gig was a basic trio with Tony Hall on drums, and was a lot of fun. Normally, I'm just too busy to be able to find the time to do a Vineyard gig, but because I was already heading down there for the weekend, it worked out perfectly.

Also, if you're ever down that way, be sure to stay at the <a href="http://www.clarkhouseinn.com/">Clark House Inn</a> in Vineyard Haven. It's a fantastic bed & breakfast run by Lisa and Bud Rusch√©. Not only was the bed super-comfy, but the breakfast was super-tasty. Good on both counts!
