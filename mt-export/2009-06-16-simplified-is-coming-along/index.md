I was caught a little off-guard by the recent [Linkinus 2.0](http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus) release, and as a result haven't yet had the time to port my popular Simplified style over to the new API. Which isn't to say that I'm not trying, in fact I'm spending all the time I can spare on it, just [take a look](http://img.skitch.com/20090616-xqb3ba7uskixxbxymnmfdi5x9b.jpg)!

Either way, I have made a lot of progress. In the process of porting Simplified, I've rewritten the majority of my v1.x code as well as all the style helper JavaScript I've come across. For example, I've already created [JavaScript Linkify](http://benalman.com/code/test/js-linkify/) and a jQuery [Long Url plugin](http://benalman.com/code/test/jquery-long-url/), both of which will be included with Simplified. I still have to handle emoticons, embedding images and videos, and a lot of other features (emoticons and embeds will be optional, of course) but It's coming along.

My real challenge is being able to fit in the Simplified styling work with everything else that I have going on right now. Because I'm not getting paid for my work, if you would like to donate to the cause, It would be *greatly* appreciated. Just click the "Donate" button in the sidebar of [my site](http://benalman.com/), and thanks!
