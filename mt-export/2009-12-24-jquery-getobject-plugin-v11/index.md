[jQuery getObject](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-getobject-plugin/) allows you to get and set properties of an object via dot-delimited name string. Inspired by the Dojo methods of the same names.

This plugin is useful if you have deep namespaces or data structures and don't want to do excessive testing like: `if ( a && a.b && a.b.c ) { ... }` every time you need to get or set a property or invoke a method.

If that's you, [check it out now](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-getobject-plugin/), and enjoy!

If that's _not_ you, check out something more interesting, like [jQuery doTimeout](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/) or [jQuery BBQ](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/).
