I keep track of pretty much all the interactive work I've ever done.. but for whatever reason, I've never actually put any of it online until now. The last few weeks have been spent organizing and documenting all these old projects, as well as writing the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XSLT, and XML to show it all off.

I'm still working on writing descriptions for everything, but as of now there are over eighty projects in there, and some of them are pretty darn cool. Just take a look at <a href="http://benalman.com/portfolio/">My Portfolio</a> and see what you think!
