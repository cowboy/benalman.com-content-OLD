Alright everybody, I'm playing next Friday night at [Lizard Lounge](http://www.lizardloungeclub.com/) in Cambridge, so you've got to come down and check it out!

I'll be playing with [Big Ben Hillman and The Royal Family](http://bigbenhillman.com/), but [Jen Kearney and The Lost Onion](http://www.jenkearney.com/) will also be doing their thing too, so don't miss it. It's going to be funky!

And if you need some sound samples, check out these tracks from [the last gig I did with Big Ben Hillman](http://benalman.com/music/big-ben-hillman-the-big-easy/).

Next Friday, April 23 at Lizard Lounge in Cambridge. Put it in your calendar!
