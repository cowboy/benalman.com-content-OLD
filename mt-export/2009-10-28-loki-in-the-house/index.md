The day has finally arrived! Robyn and I finally picked up our adorable ragdoll kitten today from [CC Bay Rags](http://www.ccbayrags.com/), and as I write this, he's exploring the living room, playing with his toys, and being a generally super-duper-adorable kitten.

He seems curious and healthy, purrs almost constantly, and is just the cutest little ball of fuzz you've ever seen. And he's already used his litterbox and scratching post, taken a few naps, eaten some food, played with the aforementioned toys.. so I think we're in good shape here. Take a look at some of the [photos](http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157622685160006/) and also the [videos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rj3/4054393122/in/set-72157622685160006/) if you want to see more!

_Update: He cried a lot last night, because we left him alone in the living room, but it's now "the morning after" and he's still alive, as is our living room.. so we're calling it a success. As I write this, Robyn is in the living room with him, in the process of being late for work, I think._
