Robyn and I recently spent a relaxing long weekend in Kennebunkport to celebrate our first wedding anniversary (June 30). And even though the weather was overcast and rainy, we had a great time. All I can say is kudos to Robyn, who did all the planning. I just wonder where we're going next year! Check out <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157606134438907/">my photos</a> from the weekend, as well as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/robynalman/sets/72157606018615326/">Robyn's photos</a>.
