Ok, so the honeymoon is officially over. Robyn and I have been home for almost a week now, back to work, and already ready for the weekend. The trip was fantastic: Seattle and Vancouver were both great, and the week-long cruise to Alaska was amazing. I think we managed to get the perfect mix of relaxation, fun, and excitement.

And all of the <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157600692792477/">honeymoon photos</a> have finally been uploaded to Flickr, so go and check them out now! I'm still working on collecting and organizing the wedding photos, so those will be up.. some time soon?
