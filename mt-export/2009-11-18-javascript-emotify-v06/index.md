[JavaScript Emotify][emotify] was originally written as a way to "pretty-up" the chat text in [Simplified](http://benalman.com/projects/simplified-style/), my [Linkinus](http://www.conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus) message theme. And like much of my code, it seemed like a good idea to make it as generalized as possible, so that others could benefit from my "hard work" (also known as "lack of something better to do with my spare time").

But I've finally created a GitHub repo, documentation, examples, and even a [page on my site][emotify] for it, so check it out!
