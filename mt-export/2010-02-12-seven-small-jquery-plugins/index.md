This morning, I decided to actually collect many of the little jQuery plugins I've created, that are too small for their own pages, into a single [jQuery Misc plugins][plugins] page. I'll add more as they're created, but here's the current list:

* [jQuery :attached, :detached](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#attached-detached)
* [jQuery getClassData](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#getclassdata)
* [jQuery getUniqueClass](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#getuniqueclass)
* [jQuery isjQuery](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#isjquery)
* [jQuery scrollbarWidth](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#scrollbarwidth)
* [jQuery serializeObject](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#serializeobject)
* [jQuery viewportOffset](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#viewportoffset)

Each plugin has both a full and minified version, along with a brief explanation and a small code sample, so [check them out][plugins] now!
