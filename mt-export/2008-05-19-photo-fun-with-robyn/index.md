Robyn recently decided to pursue her developing interest in photography by purchasing a used Nikon D70 DSLR camera and signing up for a photography class - and in celebration of the wonderful weather, we went for a nice walk along the Charles River bike path in Waltham, cameras in hand.

So, for a change of pace, you can check out not only <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/posted-on/2008/05/18/">my photos</a> from the day, but also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/robynalman/sets/72157605143820566/detail/">Robyn's photos</a>. (warning: lots of canada geese photos ahead)
