Robyn and I have been pretty busy lately. First, we celebrated <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/tags/karas30th/">Kara's 30th birthday</a>. It was fun, and Nick got to <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/2736657047/in/tag-karas30th/">use his blowtorch</a>, so it was a win-win, as far as everyone was concerned.

Not too long after that, we went to my parents' for the <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/2737621710/in/taken-on-2008-07-27/">annual Alman family barbecue</a>, where two 60th birthdays, a one-year wedding anniversary, and the successful migration of my parents' email accounts to google apps were celebrated.

And finally, last weekend we went up to New Hampshire to visit <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/taken-on/2008/08/03/">Nonni and Chet</a>. It was a great visit: we relaxed, ate some of Nonni's super-tasty home-cooked food, and their dog Ollie is <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/2736727099/in/taken-on-2008-08-03/">super cute</a> too, so yet another win-win there. Sweet.
