<div class="photo"><a href="http://benalman.com/photo/4541449435/in/set-72157623781707905/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4541449435_71eae46307_t.jpg" alt=""/></a></div>

I recently attended [JSConf X](http://jsconf.us/2010/), which as you can see from [the schedule](http://jsconf.us/2010/schedule.html) was so full of JavaScript badassery that the mind can barely comprehend the level of utter awesomeness therein.

One of the best parts was that I finally got to meet a lot of very cool developers, some of whom you can see in [my JSConf X photos](http://benalman.com/photo/sets/72157623781707905/). Of course, I spent more time talking to people than taking photos, so while there are a whole slew of [Adam Sontag dancing](http://benalman.com/photo/4542085282/in/set-72157623781707905/) photos, you won't find a "who's who of JavaScript" this time around. Maybe next year! (Who am I kidding?) Oh, I nearly forgot.. I also got to watch [Rey Bango](http://benalman.com/photo/4542079578/in/set-72157623781707905/) h4x0r [Pete Higgins' iPad](http://benalman.com/photo/4541446097/in/set-72157623781707905/). It was pretty hilarious, and I'm sure Rey is still patting himself on the back.

Another of the best parts was that I learned a lot about [server-side javascript patterns](http://www.slideshare.net/shadedecho/javascript-architecture-the-front-and-the-back-of-it-3518425) from [Kyle Simpson](http://twitter.com/getify) and a bit about what [Ryan Dahl](http://twitter.com/ryah) is doing to [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to speed things up (like, nginx-level speeds at 300 concurrent connections!!) which has me totally stoked to get right in there and start rebuilding my site!

Of course, I can't do that just yet, because I'm in the process of writing a series of articles on jQuery plugin development best practices, as well as a presentation to go with it... but it's on the list, because seriously, who doesn't get excited about this:

_Server JS + Templates ↔ "Black box" model + RESTful JSON API ↔ Client JS + Same Templates_

Ohmygawd awesome, right??

Speaking of "good parts," [Douglas Crockford](http://crockfordfacts.com/) talked about JavaScript's good and bad parts. He also slammed HTML5, which nearly everyone thinks is a bit mental, but that's ok, because he's "The Crock," and we know that he means well.

What else? Let's see... [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/)'s syntax is awesome, and now I'm frustrated because JavaScript doesn't look or act exactly like that. [Michael Mahemoff](http://mahemoff.com/) is doing some really cool [single-page app stuff](http://softwareas.com/spa-hacks) using fantastic-sounding techniques like "Iframe squirting." Apparently, [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/) is offering up a new DOM API proposal, which is [over 9000](http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Over_9000) better than the current DOM API.. [F1LT3R aka Al MacDonald](http://www.hyper-metrix.com/) dropped some WebGL science-bombs on us, and [Aaron Quint](http://www.quirkey.com/) gave the keynote presentation on [making bacon / making code](http://www.quirkey.com/blog/) including this [_amazing_ video](http://www.vimeo.com/11009641).

And that was just day 1. Well, just what I manage to remember seeing from day 1.

Now, for night 1, [we all got together on a big boat](http://benalman.com/photo/4542083484/in/set-72157623781707905/) as an excuse to drink heavily. I'm just surprised that our group of 98% dudes didn't intersect (or worse yet, collide) with the sorority party that was being held just one floor above us. I'm also very thankful that we didn't collide (or worse yet, collide catastrophically) with the prom group two floors above us (i can imagine some rather <s>brilliant</s> sketchy trading of booze-for-your-girlfriend or something equally <s>ingenious</s> inappropriate).

Day 2 was no less exciting than day 1.. apparently [SproutCore](http://www.sproutcore.com/) is the coolest web application framework that I'll never, ever use, and [Dmitry Baranovskiy](http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/) called Microsoft's VML a "stinky, smelly piece of shit" in his talk on [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com/). As I mentioned earlier, [Kyle Simpson](http://twitter.com/getify) gave his excellent ["Dude wheres my UI Architecture"](http://www.slideshare.net/shadedecho/javascript-architecture-the-front-and-the-back-of-it-3518425) talk, and [Makinde Adeagbo](http://makinde.adeagbo.com/) talked about how Facebook removed like one billion lines of JavaScript and replaced it with some [code that doesn't actually work](http://www.slideshare.net/makinde/javascript-primer/34). But, hey, [my wife](http://blog.robynalman.com/) doesn't use IE6 or 7, so it's all good.

In addition, [John-David Dalton](http://allyoucanleet.com/) got [sandboxed](http://github.com/jdalton/fusejs), [Furf](http://blurf.furf.com/) got [Sexy](http://sexyjs.com/), [Justin Meyer](http://twitter.com/justinbmeyer) got [organized](http://javascriptmvc.com/), and [Souders](http://stevesouders.com/) got even faster, giving like six talks at once (and afterwards, he also laid out a scenario in which my [loadAdScript](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#loadadscript) jQuery plugin might fail). By that point, I was wandering around a bit, trying to get my boarding pass all squared away, so I missed most of [Billy Hoffman](http://twitter.com/zoompf)'s talk as well as all of [Brendan Eich](http://web.archive.org/web/20000815055653/people.netscape.com/brendan/)'s and [Alex Russell](http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/2010/04/jsconf-metric-tons-of-awesome/)'s talks.. but next year I'm leaving "the day after" so that I won't miss anything!

All that being said, the "most" best part, however, was the booze. [Chris Williams](http://twitter.com/voodootikigod) should be commended for not only putting together two days of _amazing_ speakers together, but he also did it with a _pirate theme_, a great sense of humor, and _everyone_ had all the beers they could possibly want. That's the way it should be done.
