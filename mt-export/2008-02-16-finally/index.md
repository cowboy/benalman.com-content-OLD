It's taken a lot of time and effort, but we've finally launched the fully-redesigned <a href="http://www.quibblo.com/">Quibblo.com</a>.

Since being hired at Pangea Media at the beginning of January, I've been working non-stop with the team on re-skinning the website and creating the <a href="http://www.quibblo.com/myspace-quizzes-surveys">flash quiz widget aka "qwidget"</a> for our big "version 2.0" relaunch.

I basically hit the ground running. My first task was to just tweak and finish up the existing flash widget prototype (that I'd never even seen before) to look and feel more like the new site design. Of course, in order to make it as scalable and dynamic as was really needed, I ended up completely rewriting it from scratch. This took me almost three weeks from start to finish, but it was totally worth the effort, and we're all really happy with the final result.

And after I finished the widget, my next task was to help the team out here and there "as needed" with HTML and CSS tweaks. I started coding and soon realized that "helping out" actually meant almost completely rewriting the site's HTML and CSS. And there are a LOT of dynamic components to <a href="http://www.quibblo.com/">Quibblo.com</a>. But after a lot of work, some very late nights, and a few zillion lines of code, the site is done.

And it's badass. Especially if you're a 14-year-old who wants to find out <a href="http://www.quibblo.com/quiz/397pBC/Which-Harry-Potter-Character-Are-You">Which Harry Potter Character Are You?</a>
