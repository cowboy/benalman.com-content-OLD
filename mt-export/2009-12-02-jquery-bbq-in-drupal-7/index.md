Recently, Katherine Senzee at [Acquia](http://acquia.com/) contacted me to ask if I would consider dual-licensing my [jQuery BBQ plugin][bbq] as both MIT and GPL, because they wanted to include it in the upcoming [Drupal 7](http://drupal.org/) admin interface.

The idea is for the admin interface to appear as a modal window on top of the current page, with fully function back/forward button functionality, while maintaining the context of the current page. This is, of course, a great idea.. and one that jQuery BBQ makes easy!

Of course, I had absolutely no problem dual-licensing this plugin, and updated all my other plugins while I was at it.. because it can't hurt for people to have more options, right?

And as a result, jQuery BBQ was submitted in [a patch](http://drupal.org/node/610234#comment-2251252) to Drupal D7 that was just [committed today](http://drupal.org/cvs?commit=296664).

To me, integration in a major open-source CMS like Drupal is a big deal, and I'm really psyched. Hopefully other [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)-friendly projects will see the value in [jQuery BBQ][bbq] and will want to use it for their hash history / query string manipulation!

_And on a funny note, the [OMG THE BACK BUTTON WORKS](http://drupal.org/node/610234#comment-2329080) comment was great._
