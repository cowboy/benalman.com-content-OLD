Next Wednesday, June 2, I'll be talking jQuery plugin development at [Boston jQuery Meetup #4][meetup], in the awesome [Bocoup Loft](http://loft.bocoup.com/) event space.

I'm going to talk about code organization and best practices as it relates to creating modular, reusable code, aka "plugins." I'll focus on code maintainability, organization and generalization, and touch on performance and size optimization, in the context of jQuery plugin development. And as if that weren't enough, I'll even step through the creation of a jQuery plugin, taking it from concept to completion, before your very eyes.

So, if you use jQuery, or even just JavaScript, and want some free pizza and beer, along with ninety minutes of examples, explanations and Q&A, [sign up now][meetup], and I'll see you next week!
