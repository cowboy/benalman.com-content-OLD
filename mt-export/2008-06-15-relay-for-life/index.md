Along with thousands of people across the country, Robyn and many of her coworkers from Watertown Savings Bank participated in The American Cancer Society Relay For Life this weekend. I managed to catch up with her just after work, then again much later in the evening.. and while I was visiting, I took a <a href="http://benalman.com/photo/taken-on/2008/06/13/">few photos</a>. Robyn brought her camera with her, and took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/robynalman/sets/72157605630789576/detail/">some photos</a> of her own, so be sure to check them out too.
