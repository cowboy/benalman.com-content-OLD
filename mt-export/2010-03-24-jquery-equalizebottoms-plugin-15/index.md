I just fixed a minor bug in [jQuery equalizeBottoms][plugin] where internal padding and border would adversely affect proper bottom-equalization, and released an update.

In case you don't know, jQuery equalizeBottoms allows you to "equalize" the bottoms of multiple elements, making columns heights even, even when CSS refuses to help.

So if you haven't done so already, check out [the plugin][plugin] now, and let me know what you think!
